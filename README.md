# Flight_Delay_Detection_Description
Here is a detailed description of our "Flight Delay Detection" project:
Flight Delay Detection
Project Description
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model integrated with a Flask application to predict flight delays. The model analyzes historical flight data, weather conditions, airport congestion, and other relevant factors to make predictions. This predictive model is then incorporated into a user-friendly Flask web application, enabling travelers and airlines to anticipate potential delays and plan accordingly, thereby enhancing travel experiences and operational efficiency.
Real-Time Scenarios:
 * Travel Planning Assistance: Travelers can use the Flask application to check for potential flight delays before booking tickets. This helps them make informed travel decisions and choose flights with lower delay probabilities based on historical and real-time data.
 * Operational Efficiency for Airlines: Airlines can utilize the application to optimize flight schedules and manage resources effectively. By anticipating delays, they can proactively adjust crew assignments, gate allocations, and maintenance schedules, which helps minimize disruptions, maintain customer satisfaction, and reduce costs associated with delays and disruptions.
 * Airport Authority Decision Support: Airport authorities can leverage the application to monitor potential congestion and anticipate delays. By analyzing predicted delay data, they can implement proactive measures such as adjusting runway allocation and optimizing ground handling operations to mitigate delays, improve overall airport efficiency, enhance passenger experience, and reduce congestion-related issues.

Detailed Code Description for the Flight Delay Detection Project
We're looking for a deep dive into the code behind the Flight Delay Detection project. Let's break down each component, explaining the purpose of each file, the libraries utilized, and the specific tasks performed from data preparation to model deployment.
1.⁠ ⁠model_training.py - Building and Saving the Machine Learning Model
This Python script is the backbone of our predictive capability. It handles the crucial steps of data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and saving the trained model along with the column structure for consistent deployment.
What it does:
 * Loads Data: It starts by loading your flightdata.csv file into a pandas DataFrame.
 * Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   * The Unnamed: 25 column, which likely contains no useful information, is dropped.
   * Rows where the target variable, ARR_DEL15 (indicating an arrival delay of 15 minutes or more), are NaN are removed. This ensures we only train on complete records for our target.
   * Any remaining missing numerical values in columns like DEP_TIME, DEP_DELAY, etc., are filled using the mean imputation strategy. This prevents errors during model training caused by missing data.
 * Feature Selection: A specific set of features is chosen for the model. These include:
   * MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK (temporal information)
   * UNIQUE_CARRIER, ORIGIN, DEST (categorical identifiers for airlines and airports)
   * CRS_DEP_TIME (scheduled departure time)
   * DISTANCE (flight distance)
   * CRS_ELAPSED_TIME (scheduled flight duration)
   * DEP_DELAY (actual departure delay, a strong predictor)
   * CANCELLED, DIVERTED (binary indicators for flight status)
 * One-Hot Encoding: Categorical features (UNIQUE_CARRIER, ORIGIN, DEST) are converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding. This creates new binary columns for each unique category, making them suitable for machine learning algorithms. drop_first=True is used to prevent multicollinearity.
 * Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split (80% for training, 20% for testing). A random_state is set for reproducibility, and stratify=y ensures that the proportion of delayed vs. on-time flights is maintained in both sets.
 * Model Training: A RandomForestClassifier model is initialized and trained (.fit()) on the training data. Random Forests are ensemble learning methods that build multiple decision trees and merge their predictions to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
 * Model Saving: The trained RandomForestClassifier model is saved to a file named flight_delay_model.joblib using joblib. This allows the Flask application to load and use the model without retraining it every time.
 * Saving Encoded Columns: Crucially, the list of column names after one-hot encoding is also saved to encoded_columns.joblib. This is vital for the Flask application to ensure that any new input data is preprocessed with the exact same column order and structure as the data the model was trained on. This prevents prediction errors due to feature misalignment.
Libraries Used:
 * pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.
 * scikit-learn (sklearn): For data splitting (train_test_split), the machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier), and evaluation metrics (accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix).
 * joblib: For efficiently saving and loading Python objects, especially large NumPy arrays and scikit-learn models.
 * numpy: For numerical operations (though less directly used in this script, it's a core dependency for pandas and scikit-learn).
2.⁠ ⁠app.py - The Flask Web Application
This Flask script serves as the web interface for your project, allowing users to input flight details and receive delay predictions via a web browser.
What it does:
 * Initializes Flask App: Sets up the Flask application instance.
 * Loads Saved Assets:
   * It loads the pre-trained flight_delay_model.joblib into memory.
   * It also loads encoded_columns.joblib, which contains the list of feature names (including one-hot encoded ones) in the correct order that the model expects.
 * Home Route (/):
   * When a user navigates to the root URL (/), this route renders the index.html template, which displays the input form.
 * Prediction Route (/predict):
   * This route handles the POST request when the user submits the form.
   * Collects Input: It extracts the flight details (month, day, carrier, airports, times, delays, etc.) from the HTML form.
   * Creates Input DataFrame: These raw inputs are then assembled into a pandas DataFrame, mimicking the structure of the training data before one-hot encoding.
   * Applies One-Hot Encoding: pd.get_dummies() is applied to the new input DataFrame to convert its categorical features into numerical one-hot encoded columns, just as was done during training.
   * Aligns Features: This is a critical step: input_data_encoded.reindex(columns=encoded_columns, fill_value=0) ensures that the input DataFrame has the exact same columns in the exact same order as the training data. If a specific airport or carrier was present in the training data but not in the current input, a column for it will be created with a 0 value. If an input category was not in the training data, it won't be included as a one-hot encoded column (which is generally desired, assuming the model has learned from all relevant categories).
   * Makes Prediction: The model.predict() method is called on the input_data_aligned to get a binary prediction (0 for on-time, 1 for delayed).
   * Calculates Probability: model.predict_proba() is used to get the probability of each class (on-time vs. delayed), and the probability of delay is extracted.
   * Renders Result: Finally, it renders the index.html template again, but this time it passes the prediction result (e.g., "Delayed" or "On-time") and the delay probability back to the template for display to the user.
 * Error Handling: A basic try-except block is included to catch potential errors during input processing or prediction, providing a user-friendly error message.
 * Runs Flask App: The if _name_ == '_main_': block ensures the Flask development server runs when the script is executed directly. debug=True is set for easier development, providing detailed error messages in the browser and auto-reloading changes.
Libraries Used:
 * Flask: The web framework for building the application.
 * joblib: To load the saved machine learning model and encoded columns.
 * pandas: For creating and manipulating DataFrames for input processing.
 * numpy: Used implicitly by pandas and scikit-learn for numerical operations.
3.⁠ ⁠templates/index.html - The User Interface
This HTML file provides the simple, interactive web form where users enter the flight information. It's the front-end of your Flask application.
What it does:
 * HTML Structure: Defines the basic structure of a web page with a title, head, and body.
 * Styling: Includes basic inline CSS (<style> tags) to make the form presentable and user-friendly, setting font, margins, input styles, and button appearance.
 * Input Form: Contains a <form> element that sends data to the /predict endpoint when submitted.
   * It uses various HTML input types (number, text, select) for each required flight detail.
   * name attributes are crucial as they match the keys Flask uses to retrieve form data (request.form['field_name']).
   * required attributes ensure users fill in necessary fields.
   * min, max, and step attributes provide client-side validation for numerical inputs.
 * Prediction Result Display: Uses Jinja2 templating syntax ({% if prediction_result %}) to conditionally display the prediction outcome (prediction_result) and the calculated delay probability (delay_proba) after the model has processed the input.
Technologies Used:
 * HTML5: For structuring the web page and input forms.
 * CSS3: For styling the appearance of the web page.
 * Jinja2 (Flask's default templating engine): Allows embedding Python logic (like if statements and variable display) directly within the HTML to dynamically generate content based on the server's response.
How it All Works Together (The Workflow):
 * Preparation (Offline): You run model_training.py once. This script takes your historical flightdata.csv, cleans it, engineers features, trains the RandomForestClassifier, and saves the trained model (flight_delay_model.joblib) and the expected column order (encoded_columns.joblib).
 * Deployment (Running the App): You run app.py. Flask starts a web server.
 * User Interaction:
   * A user opens their web browser and navigates to the Flask app's URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
   * app.py receives this request and sends back index.html, which displays the empty prediction form.
   * The user fills out the form with flight details and clicks "Predict Delay."
 * Prediction Request:
   * The browser sends a POST request with the form data to app.py's /predict route.
   * app.py receives this data, converts it into a pandas DataFrame, applies the same one-hot encoding as during training, and aligns the columns using the encoded_columns.joblib file.
   * The preprocessed input is then fed into the loaded flight_delay_model.joblib.
 * Result Display:
   * The model makes a prediction (delayed/on-time) and calculates the probability.
   * app.py renders index.html again, but this time it includes the prediction outcome and probability, which are then displayed to the user.
This integrated approach combines powerful machine learning with an accessible web interface, making your Flight Delay Detection project a practical tool for real-world scenarios.
